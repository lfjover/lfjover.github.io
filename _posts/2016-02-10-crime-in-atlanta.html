<p> Crime in Atlanta is going down! I analyzed crime data maid available by the <a href = "http://www.atlantapd.org/crimedatadownloads.aspx"> Atlanta Police Department</a>. I've been living in Atlanta since 2010 and it's good to see that the city is getting progressively safer. Here, I look at the data from 2009 to 2016. </p>

<p> The data has information from previous years but the quality isn't very good (there is some data from 1916), so I'll stick with the data collected since 2009. The total number of crimes exhibits some obvious yearly seasonality. In the next post I'll look at the patterns over time. Before that, let's start by  slicing the data in different ways to see what we can learn from it. First, we can look at the crime distribution over the day of the week. </p>

<p> There is a higher number of crimes on Friday/Saturday and a lower number of crimes on Sunday (hence the exaggerated title), but overall the data looks fairly uniform. Of course, here we are combining different types of crimes. The data set contains information about 11 different types of crimes with the following distribution:</p>

<p> As we would expect the number of crimes has a large variation depending on the type. We can now see how the different types of crimes vary depending on the day of the week.</p>

We see that the trend in the total crimes is driven by the trend in the most common crimes. Larceny and burglary from residence have lower number of incidents on Sundays. This makes sense, people tend to stay at home on Sundays and so the number of burglaries goes down. There are other interesting trends in the data. The least common and worst crimes (murder and rape) go down on Thursday for some reason. I can't think of a simple explanation for this fact.
This is all for now. You can take a look at the code used to analyze this data <a ref = "https://github.com/lfjover/atlanta_crime">here</a>.
