<p> Last post we looked at the temporal patterns of crime in Atlanta. In this post we look at the spatial component of the data. It is interesting the information you can get just by looking at the data. Close to the center of the map, in Midtown Atlanta, you can see an empty area surrounded by a high density of crimes. I was able to recognize the shape of Georgia Tech. This means that, as a Graduate student, I spend most of my day in crime-free bubble surrounded by crime.

The map is to crowed to discover any interesting patterns. Let's separate last year's data by crime type to see if there are any obvious patterns:

The 2015 data suggests that there might exist a pattern in the occurrences of rape, with most cases concentrated around a specific area. To investigate this further we can look at the data over the different years.

The pattern does not look as strong for the other years. Nevertheles,the 2015 data seems to point to a more general insight, the cases appear to be concentrated around the Interstate 75 (I-75). This insight may be more general extending to all types of crime, and even I may have been personally affected by it. I live in Home Park, a neighborhood near Georgia Tech and I-75. Last weekend somebody  broken into my car and stole  my radio (I became a statistic of my own analysis). Talking to the Police Officer in charge of my case, he mentioned that the relatively high crime rate in the area is due to the proximity to the Interstate. The hypothesis being that people come from other areas to commit crimes and the Interstate provides a good escape route. With this idea in mind we can look at all the crime near Georgia Tech since 2009.

I marked the highway exits in blue and planned to calculate crime as a function of the distance to the nearest exit to the I-75. But, looking at the data it is apparent that, at least at this scale, the distance to the closest I-75 exit is not a factor. Instead we see specific streets and areas that have higher number of crimes. At a larger scale, there may exist a correlation, but population density is also  higher closer to I-75, so it would be necessary to normalize the data.  We can also separate the data near Georgia Tech  by type of crime:
